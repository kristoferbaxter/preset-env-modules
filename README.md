# Demonstrate @babel/preset-env with ESModules targetting

With the release of Babel 7 (beta 39 and beyond) one can now specifically target devices supporting ESModules.

This can greatly reduce the amount of JavaScript sent to modern devices without adding significant effort.

This example shows how one can apply the technique.

## Installation
1. Clone this repo.
2. `yarn` to install dependencies.
3. `yarn start` to startup a localhost:3000 server with a sample page.

Good luck, and let's send users less JavaScript!
